# Counting Isosceles Triangles in an N x M Grid

A triangle is called isosceles if it has two sides of equal
length. Two triangles are considered to be different if they have
different sets of vertices. You have a grid of N x M square cells.
Return the number of different isosceles triangles you can form using
only the centers of grid cells as vertices.

- N will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.
- M will be between 1 and 200, inclusive.
